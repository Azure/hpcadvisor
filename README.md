## HPC Advisor

The goal of this tool is to assist users in selecting a cluster configuration
based on actual application executions. It contains three components: data
collector, plot generator, and recommendation generator. For now the tool
focuses on testing:

- SKUs
- Number of cluster nodes
- Processes per node
- Application input parameters

It can be executed using both CLI and browser.
